BITalino LSL Streaming
======================

This module connects to a BITalino device via Bluetooth/Serial and streams
data over LSL (Lab Streaming Layer) with high-precision timestamping.

It utilizes the StableClock RLS filter (identical to the Muse implementation)
to map device sample counts to LSL time, correcting for clock drift.
